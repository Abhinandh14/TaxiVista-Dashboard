The dashboard will introduce an approach of "data driven" React application that will focus on visualizing the taxi data of Chicago City. The project is tailored to fill data analysis needs, using data accessed from taxi trips, providing an option login and view the insights and correlations found from the trips helpful for future analysis.

The main objective focuses specifically on solving the problems by developing a data driven React application uniquely designed to visualize and analyze data on taxi trips from 2013-2023 combined with React.js, Firebase authentication and Recharts visualization libraries. This project aims to promote equal access to transport data, explore more about taxi rides and engage various stakeholders from transport analysts, decision makers, researchers, and urban planners.
